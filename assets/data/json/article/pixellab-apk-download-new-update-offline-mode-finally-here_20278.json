The highlight of this update is the ability to edit and save projects entirely offline, a feature that has been highly requested by users. This change will directly impact users who frequently work in remote locations or face unstable internet connections, providing them with uninterrupted access to Pixellab's editing tools.</p>\n<h2>Deep Dive into What's New</h2>\n<h3>New Feature: Offline Mode</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Offline Mode</strong> allows users to access all core editing features without requiring an internet connection. Users can now create, edit, and save projects locally on their devices. This feature is particularly beneficial for professionals and hobbyists who work in areas with poor connectivity. To use Offline Mode, simply open the app while offline, and all previously downloaded assets and tools will remain accessible. Projects saved offline can later be synced to the cloud when an internet connection is available.</p>\n<img alt=\"Pixellab Offline Mode interface showing local project saving options\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/202511/201b41c1a1ffe78020b8c852d14e04d0.jpg\"/>\n<h3>User Interface Overhaul</h3>\n<p>The update also includes a <strong>redesigned user interface</strong> aimed at improving navigation and accessibility.
