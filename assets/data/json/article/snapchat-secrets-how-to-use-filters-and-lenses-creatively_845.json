To switch between the front and rear cameras, simply tap the camera icon in the top right corner. Basic functions like taking photos, recording videos, and saving your snaps are straightforward and intuitive.</p>\n<div class=\"adv_slot_container\"> </div>\n<h3>First Experience with Filters and Lenses</h3>\n<p>Filters and lenses are what make Snapchat unique.
