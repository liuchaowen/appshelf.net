This holiday may come just once a year (well, twice if you count the endless leftovers), but nothing beats the comfort of a traditional Thanksgiving feast. From a perfectly roasted turkey and buttery stuffing to mashed potatoes swimming in gravy, the classics never fail. And of course, dessert is non-negotiable—think pumpkin pie, pecan pie cheesecake, and all the sweet treats that make the day complete. So get ready to gather, indulge, and maybe even sneak in a post-turkey nap, because these 10<strong data-end=\"818\" data-start=\"782\"> must-try Thanksgiving recipes</strong> are here to make your holiday unforgettable.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Overhead of a table filled with different Thanksgiving dishes \" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/4tXBXOtbb6NEyvWOR-vek9-ZZJY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__images__2016__10__20150923-Thanksgiving-spread-vicky-wasik-001-d700f024877d426681246911c9a88b11.jpg\"/></p>\n<h3>1. Crisp-Skinned Butterflied Roast Turkey With Gravy</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Spatchcocked Turkey on a wooden carving board surrounded by Thanksgiving dishes\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/tEI7Kws4IwEAq31bz04h6aXW42w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/20221103-Crisp-Skinned-Spatchcocked-Butterflied-Roast-Turkey-With-Gravy-Recipe-FredHardy-Hero-d4e17a9e8adb48fe9e65ec72a76aa7fe.JPG\"/></p>\n<p>Our <strong data-end=\"162\" data-start=\"125\">butterflied (spatchcocked) turkey</strong> recipe keeps things simple with a dry brine—just rub kosher salt all over the bird and let it rest in the fridge overnight. By removing the backbone with poultry shears (trust us, it’s easier than it sounds!), the turkey cooks more quickly and evenly, giving you perfectly juicy meat. And don’t toss that backbone! It’s packed with cartilage and flavor, making it the perfect base for a rich, hearty gravy.</p>\n<h3>2. Basic Cranberry Sauce</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Finished cranberry sauce in a small bowl next to a bowl of stuffing with a gold spoon\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/DgmyxLfllR3VhVR35DSK7ftchDE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/The-Food-Lab-Worlds-Easiest-Thanksgiving-CranberrySauce-FredHardy_Hero-58df534e37354d41984f48ec1cdb0738.JPG\"/></p>\n<p>There are endless cranberry sauce recipes out there, but if you’re after something classic, easy, and traditional (without resorting to the can), this is the one. All it takes is fresh cranberries, sugar, water, and a pinch of salt, with a splash of orange juice to brighten the tartness and give it a perfectly balanced flavor.</p>\n<h3>3. Classic Sage and Sausage Stuffing (or Dressing)</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"A large copper-colored serving spoon lifting a spoonful of cooked stuffing out of a pan, which is in the background.\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/JzNJu7BwyKM-Vi81Tkp-BWqFTyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/20220428-classic-sage-and-sausage-stuffing-mariel-delacruz-Hero-5b07d5d42539446cb57b1bce096fca56.JPG\"/></p>\n<p>For me, Thanksgiving is all about the stuffing—moist, fluffy, and packed with flavor. This version is loaded with sage, juicy bites of sausage, and just the right amount of garlic, plus tender celery and onion for that classic balance. A whole stick of butter gives it rich depth (and yes, it’s absolutely worth it). And if by some miracle you have leftovers, try pressing them into a waffle iron—stuffing waffles are the ultimate day-after-Thanksgiving treat.</p>\n<h3>4. The Ultimate Homemade Green Bean Casserole</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"A green bean casserole in a casserole dish\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/-c9gib67hYJZ2CYBU6PYOEbXgT4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__images__2016__10__20150923-Thanksgiving-spread-vicky-wasik-019-thumb-1500xauto-427106-7a61118210e54ad59a0d3ffa8e976140.jpg\"/></p>\n<p data-end=\"373\" data-start=\"96\">The canned-soup shortcut works in a pinch, but if you’re craving nostalgia <strong data-end=\"178\" data-start=\"171\">and</strong> great flavor, the from-scratch route is the way to go. Think crisp, freshly blanched green beans, a creamy mushroom sauce made with real mushrooms, and crispy fried shallots you make yourself.</p>\n<h3 data-end=\"373\" data-start=\"96\">5.  The Best Roasted Sweet Potatoes</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Cooked sweet potatoes in a blue bowl\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/TH8nPAzg72ThWuthohCPIOqyfKY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__recipes__images__2015__11__20150923-Thanksgiving-spread-vicky-wasik-004-choose-sides-c68226da83c542ed8fc9cbee67326175.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Sweet potatoes deserve to shine, but too often they turn out bland or starchy. The secret here is a quick par-cook: simmering the potatoes in water between 135 and 170°F (57–77°C) before roasting. At this temperature, an enzyme kicks in that transforms starch into maltose, giving the potatoes natural sweetness and incredible flavor. From there, a short roast delivers those irresistible crisp, caramelized edges.</p>\n<p>And the best part? You only need a handful of ingredients—sweet potatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper, plus a touch of honey and parsley—for a side dish that’s as simple as it is delicious.</p>\n<h3>6.  Easy Roasted Brussels Sprouts</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Roasted Brussels sprouts in a Dutch oven\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/gC1k1gTiYCrN4OAucEU48qB3_xY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__images__2016__10__roasted-brussels-sprouts-thumb-1500xauto-427066-2df69505e29f441a9c671c6a6028c8a6.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>If you’re still steaming or boiling Brussels sprouts, it’s time for an upgrade. Here’s all it takes: trim and halve the sprouts, toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, roast until golden and crisp, and serve. That’s it—simple, effortless, and incredibly tasty. Plus, you can say goodbye to any sulfur-y fridge smells from leftovers.</p>\n<h3>7.  Ultra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"A bowl of fluffy mashed potatoes sits on a table. It's topped with a pat of melting butter and a grinding of fresh black pepper.\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/m5xk-phIb6-VJdTp5YGzm7P713g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/20220204-fluffy-mashed-potatoes-vicky-wasik-11-245a515bafbe4c6e9ca9172fb44dfb6e.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Perfectly fluffy mashed potatoes come down to one key step: minimizing starch. Start by peeling and dicing russets, then rinse them well in cold water before boiling until tender. Give them another rinse to wash away any lingering starch, then run them through a ricer or food mill. The right tool makes all the difference—unlike a blender or food processor, these won’t overwork the potatoes, keeping your mash smooth, airy, and light.</p>\n<h3>8.  Butternut Pumpkin Pie</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"A slice of pumpkin pie on a plate with a dollop of whipped cream on top \" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/pUdWBmphwH0FrJZSWA1y03X_vAc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__images__2017__11__20170914-bravetart-pumpkin-pie-vicky-wasik-13-84f249effebd48abb7f57f5b5015af03.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Fun fact: that “pumpkin” purée in the can? It’s almost always butternut squash—and honestly, that’s a win. Squash packs a deeper, sweeter flavor and is far easier to work with than true pumpkin.</p>\n<p>Stella’s butternut pie shows off just how good it can be: roasted squash blended with homemade condensed milk, brown sugar, vanilla, and plenty of warm spice. The result? A silky, fragrant filling that beats old-school pumpkin any day.</p>\n<p>And if from-scratch feels like too much, canned squash still makes a pie that’s rich, creamy, and crowd-pleasing—no apologies needed.</p>\n<h3>9.  Classic Pecan Pie</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Overhead of a pecan pie\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/thmb/MS40LEI-oMcImrjeaPK3yj6C9qY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__images__2016__10__20151017-pecan-pie-vicky-wasik-15-thumb-1500xauto-427612-bc399596103c46f99d9517f16b89235e.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>No Thanksgiving dessert table is complete without a classic pecan pie. This version keeps things sweet and balanced with a blend of honey, corn syrup, and brown sugar, while vanilla and a pinch of salt round out the flavor. Toasted pecans bring that signature nutty crunch, and blind-baking the crust ensures it stays crisp beneath the rich, custardy filling. The end result? A pie that’s equal parts smooth, crunchy, and irresistible.</p>\n<h3>10. Perfect Gravy</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Best Ever Turkey Gravy\" src=\"https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/L_CLuODErGNOKereH0aCNFWef4Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/simply-recipes-best-gravy-lead-1-bcc2e1b63317449cae49f00b7c3c2ced.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Homemade gravy is the ultimate holiday essential, whether you’re pouring it over juicy turkey, creamy mashed potatoes, or warm, buttery biscuits. Because it plays such a central role on the table, it has to be flawless—and this recipe delivers just that.</p>\n<h3>Cook Your Thanksgiving Dinner with Tasty</h3>\n<p>What's that?
