The air was alive and buzzing with the hum of excitement as the young wolves danced and laughed together. My eyes scanned the crowded dance floor, searching for familiar faces. Ashley, was quick to join in and was somewhere out there, lost in the rhythm of the music.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As I walked through the crowd of people, I spotted the VIP section, courtesy of Ryder Watkins, the club's owner and a pack member.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I took my seat as the guys went off to the bar, my gaze drifting back to the dance floor for a quick glance. Ashley was still dancing, oblivious to the commotion around her. I soon felt a spark on my shoulder when I turned Lucas leaned in, his voice low.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The guys are busy talking to another alpha; they'll probably be a while. As for Ashley, she's been dancing and enjoying herself. Let's get a few moments to ourselves.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before I could protest, Lucas slipped his arm around my waist and steered me toward the back of the club. I felt a flutter in my chest as he pulled me into the shadows, but I tried to brush it off as mere excitement.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"What's going on?\" I asked, my voice barely audible over the music.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I want some time alone with you,\" Lucas whispered, his breath tickling my ear.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I hesitated, unsure about what was happening. Lucas had never made a move before, and I wasn't sure how to react. But as he led me through the dark corridors of the club, I found myself wanting to be alone with him.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, we reached the back door, and Lucas pushed it open with a force. We stepped into a private room, dimly lit and quiet after the chaos of the club. The door creaked shut behind us, leaving us alone in the silence.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas turned to me, his eyes burning with intensity. I felt a jolt of electricity as he stepped closer, his body brushing against mine. I tried to step back, but my feet seemed to be rooted to the spot.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas's lips descended upon mine, and I felt a spark ignite within me. I was caught up in the moment, my body responding to his without my consent. It was like a dam had burst within me, and emotions I had been holding back since I found out we are mates came flooding out.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I lost myself in the kiss, my mind spinning out of control. Time seemed to fly by and before I knew it, we were lost in a frenzy of passion and desire.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I was vaguely aware of Lucas's hands on my skin, his fingers tracing the contours of my face. I felt his teeth graze my neck, sending shivers down my spine. The sensations overwhelmed me, leaving me gasping for air.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It wasn't until we broke apart for a breath that I realized what had happened. Lucas's eyes sparkled with a knowing glint, and I felt a flush rise to my cheeks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Lucas,\" I whispered, my voice trembling. \"We...we can't do this.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">He pulled back, his eyes searching mine for understanding. \"What do you mean?\" he asked, his brow furrowed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We've almost fully mated,\" I stated the obvious, my heart sinking with the realization.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas's expression softened, and he stepped closer, his hands on my arms. \"That's not a bad thing, Emily. We're mates; it's only natural.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"But what about Ashley?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas hesitated, his eyes darting away for a moment before focusing on me. \"I...I'll talk to her. Tonight. And I'll break things off with her.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I shook my head, my heart heavy with the knowing of what I have done. \"We can not let this happen again. Not until you're free to claim me as your true mate.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas's face fell, and for a moment, I thought I saw disappointment there. But he nodded, his jaw set in determination.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I'll clear things up with Ashley tonight, Emily. And then...then I'll claim you as mine.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The words sent a shiver down my spine. I felt a flutter in my chest as I nodded, my heart pounding.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But a small voice within me whispered warning me to be caution. I couldn't help but wonder if Lucas was truly ready for a mate bond, or if he was just caught up in the passion of the moment.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And what would happen if he wasn't?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My heart hammered a frantic rhythm against the club's controlled pulse, a clash of chaos and order. I pushed through the remaining chaos of the dance floor, my gaze trained on the familiar haven of the VIP section. Each flashing light was a judgment, each beat a disapproval.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reaching the velvet rope, I flashed a practiced smile at the guard, and slipped inside. The music, though softened, still managed to assault my senses. The air was thick with a chaotic energy, the promise of a storm to come. Lucas was already there, the dim light reflecting off the ice in his whiskey, each clink a death knell to my sanity. I sank into the cushioned embrace of the booth.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Hey,\" Lucas said, his voice barely reaching me above the noise. He slid a drink my way, the alcohol offering a false sense of security.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Hey,\" I replied, my voice a mere echo of his. My insides churned with a familiar anxiety, a beast I struggled to tame.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We sat in a tense silence, the roar of the crowd a backdrop to the chaos brewing between us. Ashley, blissfully unaware of the impending turmoil, was still lost on the dance floor. I knew I had to address the elephant in the room, to confront this escalating reality before it swallowed us whole.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Taking a breath, I spoke, my voice barely audible above the music, \"So... about what just happened...\" The words felt inadequate, failing to encapsulate the whirlwind of emotions that had erupted.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lucas leaned in, his dark eyes locking on mine, his features betraying a hint of apprehension. \"look like I said before, I'll talk to Ashley tonight, Emily. Properly. And then... we'll figure things out.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The words hung in the air, heavy with potential and the looming possibility of heartbreak. The 'we' felt like a punch to the gut. A mate bond was a dream for most, a reality that often went unrealized. I felt a primal urge to flee, to disappear into the crowd. But I knew I couldn't run. Not now.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hesitation gripped me. Lucas's impulsiveness was notorious, and I questioned his readiness for the deep commitment a bond entailed. \"I need you to be clear with Ashley,\" I said, my voice firm, a desperate plea hidden beneath a veneer of authority. \"I don't want to be the 'other woman,' Lucas. I want no vagueness. I want no messy situations.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">He nodded, jaw tight, a muscle working in his cheek. \"I understand, Emily. I will take care of it. I will tell Ashley how I feel.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I nodded, the doubt gnawing at me. I studied his features, trying to decipher his intentions. Was he truly ready to sever the bond he shared with Ashley? Or was he allowing the passion of the moment to overrule his judgment? He had always been careful, and the pack dynamics could crumble.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just then, Ashley stumbled off the dance floor, her face flushed, her eyes bright with a drunken joy. She seemed oblivious to the magnitude of the changes taking place beneath her feet. \"Hey, guys,\" she slurred, her voice barely carrying over the music as she collapsed onto the stool beside me.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Hey, Ashley,\" Lucas said, his voice smooth and carefully neutral. I could feel the gears in his mind turning.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ashley leaned in, her voice a conspiratorial whisper above the noise. \"Lucas... could I talk to you for a minute? Away from all this chaos?\" Her eyes sparkled in the flickering lights.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I raised an eyebrow, my eyes on Lucas, waiting for a sign. He shot me a brief, unreadable look, a hint of uncertainty crossing his face. Then, he nodded and followed Ashley towards a quieter area, away from the flashing lights and thumping bass.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I watched them go, my stomach churning. Was Lucas ready? Could I possibly be a home wrecker?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">....</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Want to read more about this story? We'll be updating it soon!</p>\n</div> </div>",
