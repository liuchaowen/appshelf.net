  "review_html": "<div class=\"reviewcon reviewcon-n topicpageaticle\">\n<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of <strong>Squid Game: Unleashed</strong>, a game where every move could be your last. Inspired by the hit Netflix series Squid Game, this multiplayer battle royale tests your skills, instincts, and ability to outlast opponents in brutal, fast-paced competitions. Whether you’re navigating iconic challenges like Red Light, Green Light or the treacherous Glass Bridge, one wrong move can mean certain death. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you survive and thrive in Squid Game: Unleashed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Squid Game reference\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/e61bc987440ea5cda78ba9c11f185fb9.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Mastering the Basics</h2>\n<p>The first step to becoming the ultimate survivor is understanding the basic mechanics and objectives of each game. Squid Game: Unleashed features several reimagined games from the show, as well as new, original contests designed to test your skill and strategy.</p>\n<h2>Red Light, Green Light</h2>\n<p>In this game, patience is key. You must stop moving the moment the eerie doll, Young-hee, announces \"Red light.\" Failing to do so will get you eliminated. A useful tip is to stop moving a few seconds before the timer runs out, minimizing the risk of being caught. Also, keep the sound on to quickly respond to the alarm bell. Once you cross the finish line, take advantage of the situation to eliminate some competition by using the gift bats that appear. These bats break after one hit, so be strategic.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Red Light, Green Light\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/cfac9bb696c85e7b68d013dcda16359d.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 485px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Glass Bridge</h2>\n<p>Rushing is rarely a good idea in the Glass Bridge game. Instead, observe the NPCs (non-player characters) who often sprint ahead and fall to their deaths, revealing the correct path. If you must go first, use the corners of the tiles to test their stability without fully committing to a jump. This technique increases your chances of survival.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Glass Bridge game\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/8fd9910fa742d815546cf67524209012.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 361px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Floor Is Lava</h2>\n<p>In this nightmare scenario, jumping and fighting for space on ever-changing small islands is essential. Aim to knock opponents off with a baseball bat, a trusty tool in this game. Always be on the move and anticipate the rising and sinking platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Floor Is Lava\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/e3ddc834a8d68e525fd672adf1378016.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Late for School</h2>\n<p>This game requires navigating various obstacles like hedges, electrified swimming pools, and flaming BBQ grills. When crossing busy streets, patience is crucial. Don’t rush; wait for the first cohort of buses to pass, then make your move.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Late for School\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/a58a0fcc0bfb5575b941d3b19a4f43a8.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Stair Race</h2>\n<p>Success in the Stair Race is all about timing and anticipating platform movements. Navigate rising and falling platforms by planning your vertical movements and avoiding horizontally moving obstacles. Watch for red squares on the floor indicating impending danger, and aim for the most direct route to the finish line.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Stair Race\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/4615b19cd3ee22cf488feafa5bf79439.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 336px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Dalgona</h2>\n<p>In this modern take on the classic game, run over discs with shapes to carve out holes in the giant cookie serving as the floor. Quickness and precision are vital as you race to the bottom.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Dalgona game\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/f21a26835da784bf23c0e12ffd2a897e.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 409px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Snow Day</h2>\n<p>Being the last one standing is crucial in this game filled with breaking ice panels and other players. Go for power-ups and plan your jumps carefully. Stay tactical and focused to avoid falling prey to a dodgeball or a collapsing ice panel.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Snow Day\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/935c15f0c619e52f42e13695ae2befa3.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>The Squid Game</h2>\n<p>Stay near the center of the squid-shaped court and work your way outwards. Use the items scattered around to maintain a defensive position and edge out your opponents.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Squid Game\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/e2290cec33b82ca26a60313e93468674.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Advanced Strategies</h2>\n<h2>Team Up with Friends</h2>\n<p>Teaming up can significantly increase your survival chances. In games like Tug of War, having an extra set of hands can make all the difference. A friend can act as a decoy in the Glass Bridge game, revealing safe paths without you taking the risk. Remember to return the favor to keep the game enjoyable for everyone.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Team Up with Friends\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/b45a815ff429ced662e9679fd0b10e55.png\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Progression and Essential Skills</h2>\n<p>As you progress in Squid Game: Unleashed, you’ll unlock new maps, avatars, and characters. Though new maps bring more challenges, mastering essential moves like flying kicks, sliding, and mid-air direction changes can give you an edge. Practice these skills on easier maps to prepare for advanced levels.</p>\n<h2>Sliding:</h2>\n<p>Perform a forward slide by pulling the left joystick down while pressing the jump button. This move is faster than running and can be a game-changer in races.</p>\n<h2>Flying Kick:</h2>\n<p>Use this move to dodge attacks, especially useful when someone swings a bat at you.</p>\n<h2>Mid-Air Direction Change:</h2>\n<p>Master this skill to make quick adjustments during jumps, crucial for surviving the Glass Bridge challenge.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Essential Skills\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/e24a9ac280334afdc5aae665c94b6752.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Should You Change Characters?</h2>\n<p>While new characters in Squid Game: Unleashed are purely cosmetic, choosing whether to stand out or blend in can affect your gameplay. Beginners might find it easier to blend in with NPCs, avoiding targeted attacks from other players. Advanced players, however, might prefer unique skins to flaunt their skills, despite the increased risk.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Change Characters\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/d6d8ebd14a91f18c180801f03c4e5da9.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 410px;\" width=\"728\"/></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Surviving Squid Game: Unleashed isn’t merely about luck; it’s about mastering the skills and strategies to outsmart opponents. With these tips, you’ll be better prepared to face the brutal challenges ahead, whether dodging attacks, choosing the right paths, or collaborating with friends.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Conclusion\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20241220/4e855b4c3d954f33d591f0d69301ca35.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: 364px;\" width=\"728\"/></p> </div>",
