Simply do your own thing, that’s the motto of the game. No hand-holding comes with its own set of benefits, such as adding your own characters, creating their own storyline, and controlling the scenarios how you like.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-CE2hd7XonomQesxpO6ecQ4s4nXc\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/a4b90bfd60b743c2a49e34948945dc30.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"555\"/></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-UzM6d7Ugzo9LSvxLbNJcshg9nZq\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-UzM6d7Ugzo9LSvxLbNJcshg9nZq\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(248, 95, 166);\"><strong>Tip2: Explore Secrets Hidden in this Majestic World!</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-Hf23dAAPXoYCnnxsP8McQsD5nQd\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">Toca Life World: Build a Story has some of the best written characters and NPCs, as acclaimed by many of the veterans. The developers have put in a lot of work to ensure players find it entertaining to talk with them and unlock the secrets attached with them. Vague speaking’s are perhaps one of the best signs of detecting a hidden secret. These secrets can be either information or actual in-game resources as reward, depending on the toughness. They can be found at different locations. Some of the secrets are as follows:</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-I3C5d2w1yodxWBxnlgwcjuDpnXb\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/f8ac3997c3c61034f565d2d2e1176021.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"555\"/></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">💡 By tapping on bushes in Little Hill, players can locate a spot to conceal an item.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">💡 By tapping on the tree branches in the park, players can locate the hidden eggs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">💡 Behind the “No Sloth” poster, players can access a sloth costume that is concealed in the storage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">💡 One more secret that needs to be revealed by the players is to open the cupboard to reveal the hidden flowers on the mall’s first floor.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-WCt9dKIQsoTdWBxymZ9chZkdnLe\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(248, 95, 166);\"><strong>Tip3: Get a Secret Pet for Free!</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-OCLGdr4pioDv7Jx9cG3coeppnkg\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">That’s right! You can get a free Secret Trumpet, or Secret Pet in Toca Life World: Build a Story. These are tiny and cute creatures that are quite hard to collect and get access for in the game. They have not much usage in-game but Secret pets are more viewed as collector’s items that only veterans know about. The trick to finding and collecting more Secret Pets is by ensuring the right combination of character and items they are holding is met. These conditions are extremely tough to crack and many Secret Pets are still hidden from the public. Go to the Storage area with specific characters and holding certain items to lure in these cute furry creatures.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-Oa3BdbQLxoauHbx7ElXcrqQpnZg\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/83c0b819ae783a7df42a07e034a93d45.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"555\"/></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-REEfdKHNNoutTWxB5VXcyPninyh\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-REEfdKHNNoutTWxB5VXcyPninyh\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(248, 95, 166);\"><strong>Tip4: Get Tons of Gifts!</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-D29Odlwxco2I8DxXAFycI0V2nfc\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">The post office gives gifts to players, but is it possible to receive gifts unlimited times? Yes, players do receive fresh gift tokens each time they restart the game by shutting it down, and that’s a great feature. Players can therefore exit the game, relaunch it, visit the post office, and obtain a fresh gift token in order to amass an infinite number of gifts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-Lxc9dkp2qoRKHvxd2JUcBb7qnVe\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/62ea8667ffce582c5df1c715d56eddda.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"555\"/></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-L0WYdKczComW3cxrJc0cUiV3nge\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-L0WYdKczComW3cxrJc0cUiV3nge\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(248, 95, 166);\"><strong>Tip5: Create Your Very Own Actors</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-MKKWdnvmEoKL9nx6LH3cadIAngb\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">Since of the core selling points of Toca Life World: Build a Story is to sell players the dream of creating and managing their own characters, it’s not out of the box to think they actually managed to do that! To make your world more realistic, you need to fill them with more characters. Each could be similar or diverse, entirely depending on your choice. The ability to customize your characters to your tastes is a feature of this game. However, you have the option to access pre-designed characters anywhere you like if you feel that your creativity is insufficient for creating the characters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-X2CodvBa8o06K1xaQGCc4Q8hnvc\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">While it’s nice to have access to the early characters, making your own character brings you much more happiness and excitement. You can alter a character’s height, age, choice of clothing and accessories, and facial features when you create them in the game. However, there exists a limit on how freely you can create characters in the game. This cap or limit can only be lifted if you choose to purchase the creator package.</span></p>\n</div> </div>",
