It categorizes reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, enabling moderators to prioritize flagged content efficiently. For instance, a review stating 'The product is terrible' will be automatically flagged as negative, while 'Great experience!' will be marked as positive. This reduces the need for manual intervention and ensures faster response times.</p>\n<img alt=\"Real-time sentiment analysis of reviews in WhatsApp Reviews using NLP\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/202511/fb8d36ebc3b12153d3a63badcc0e6e14.jpg\"/>\n<h3>Enhanced Review Filtering Options</h3>\n<p>The update introduces customizable filters based on keywords, ratings, and sentiment. Users can now exclude reviews containing specific keywords (e.g., 'broken' or 'defective') or focus on reviews with particular ratings (e.g., 4 stars and above).
