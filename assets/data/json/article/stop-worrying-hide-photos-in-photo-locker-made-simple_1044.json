Here’s how to get started: First, download and install the app from your device’s app store. When you open it for the first time, set up a master password—this is your key to keeping everything secure. For added protection, you can enable fingerprint or pattern unlock. To hide photos or videos, simply open the app, tap the ‘Add’ button, and select the files you want to protect. Once confirmed, they’re safely tucked away. To view your hidden media, just unlock the app with your master password and browse through your private collection.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Step-by-step guide to setting up master password and adding photos in Hide Photos in Photo Locker\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/202511/a336f3340f9b1a38345f7d6f98863eb6.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>Advanced Techniques for Enhanced Privacy</h2>\n<p>If you’re serious about privacy, Hide Photos in Photo Locker has some powerful tools to help.

The backup and restore function makes it easy to transfer your data by saving it to cloud storage or an external device.
