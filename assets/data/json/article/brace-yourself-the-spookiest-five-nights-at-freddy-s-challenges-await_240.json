Running out of power means certain doom.</li>\n<li><strong>Camera Monitoring</strong>: Keep a close eye on the cameras, but don't spend too much time on them. Balancing your time is key.</li>\n<li><strong>Door Control</strong>: Use doors selectively to block animatronics, but remember that keeping them closed drains power.</li>\n<li><strong>Calm Under Pressure</strong>: Stay calm and collected. Panicking can cause mistakes and lead to a quick end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Tips for Surviving Five Nights\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5gIGGYNRjT4/maxresdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<p>Whether you're a veteran player or new to the five nights at Freddy's world, there’s no shortage of thrilling challenges to keep you on the edge of your seat.
