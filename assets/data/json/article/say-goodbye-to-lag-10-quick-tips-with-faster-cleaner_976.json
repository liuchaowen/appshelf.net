  "review_html": "<div class=\"reviewcon reviewcon-n topicpageaticle\">\n<h2>Getting Started with Faster Cleaner</h2>\n<p>To begin optimizing your phone with Faster Cleaner, the first step is to download and install the app. You can easily find Faster Cleaner on Google Play or the App Store. Once installed, launch the app and complete the initial setup, which includes granting necessary permissions for the app to function effectively. The main interface is intuitively designed, featuring key modules such as Clean, Boost, and Battery Optimization, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"576\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20250509/857e17694e92825ce9d6027369f6e52a.png\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<h3>Basic Operations</h3>\n<p>Cleaning junk files is straightforward. Open Faster Cleaner, tap the 'Clean' button, select the types of files you wish to remove (like cache and residual files), and then hit 'Start Cleaning'. To speed up your phone, simply click 'Boost' on the main interface, review the currently running apps and memory usage, and select the apps to close before tapping 'One-Click Boost'. For battery optimization, navigate to the 'Battery' section, review the usage and suggestions, and enable 'Power Saving Mode' or 'Super Power Saving Mode' as needed.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>\n<p>Faster Cleaner also offers advanced features like scheduled cleaning. Access the 'Settings' menu, find the 'Scheduled Cleaning' option, and set your preferred time and frequency, such as daily at 2 AM. For a more thorough cleanup, use the 'Deep Clean' feature by clicking on it from the main interface, scanning for large and redundant files, and then deleting the unnecessary ones. Managing your apps is also simplified; enter the 'App Management' module, review app usage and permissions, and uninstall or freeze rarely used apps.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20250509/8f039efd0b91903fd7c3dce986a72001.png\"/></p>\n<h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>\n<p>It's important to avoid over-cleaning, which can lead to system instability. Cleaning once a day is sufficient. Similarly, neglecting battery optimization can shorten battery life, so it's recommended to optimize your battery weekly. Additionally, regularly check and manage app permissions to prevent misuse by certain applications.</p>\n<h3>FAQ</h3>\n<p>Q: Does Faster Cleaner affect phone performance?</p>\n<p>A: No, it's designed to enhance performance.</p>\n<p>Q: Can data be recovered after cleaning?</p>\n<p>A: No, ensure important data is backed up before cleaning.</p>\n<p>Q: Does scheduled cleaning consume battery?</p>\n<p>A: It runs only at set times with minimal battery usage.</p>\n<p>Q: Does deep clean delete important files?</p>\n<p>A: It targets large and redundant files, not system or personal data.</p>\n<p>Q: How to cancel scheduled cleaning?</p>\n<p>A: Go to 'Settings', find 'Scheduled Cleaning', and turn it off.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20250509/8f3bbd91d4af1c9bc68006108b05c0c6.png\"/></p>\n<h3>Practical Applications</h3>\n<p>For instance, User A set automatic cleaning daily at 2 AM, resulting in a smooth, non-lagging phone each morning. User B freed up 5GB of space by deleting redundant files through deep cleaning, significantly speeding up the phone. User C extended battery life from 8 to 12 hours by optimizing the battery weekly.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://dl.xlap.top/details/faster-cleaner\">Faster Cleaner</a>.</p> </div>",
