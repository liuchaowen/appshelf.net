Players can specify parameters such as biome type, elevation range, and resource distribution, and the AI will create a fully detailed planet. This tool is accessible from the \"Planet Editor\" menu, where users can preview and tweak the generated designs before finalizing them.</p>\n<p><strong>Application Example:</strong> A player wants to create a desert planet with rare mineral deposits. They input \"desert biome\" and \"high mineral density,\" and the AI generates a planet with sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and mineral-rich zones.</p>\n<img alt=\"AI-driven planet customization interface with sliders for biome type, elevation, and resource density\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/202511/72aa1ddcae8b71c7565b574d7a413d24.jpg\"/>\n<h3>Enhanced Multiplayer Stability</h3>\n<p>This update addresses frequent multiplayer issues, including latency spikes and sudden disconnections.
