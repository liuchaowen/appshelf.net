Where do you start? How do you navigate the vast repository of historical data? Enter MyHeritage, a comprehensive genealogy platform that brings your ancestors' untold stories to life through its sophisticated matching technologies and vast collection of historical records.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"MyHeritage genealogy platform\" src=\"https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/images/featured-articles/2023/who-do-you-think-you-are/02126/header.webp\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>The Power of MyHeritage</h2>\n<p>MyHeritage is not just another genealogy website; it’s a revolutionary tool for uncovering your roots and understanding your heritage. Unlike many other platforms, MyHeritage offers a plethora of unique features that make it one of the most comprehensive genealogy tools available. With MyHeritage, you get access to the Discoveries engine, Smart Matches™, Instant Discoveries™, and a DNA testing kit that can unlock deep familial connections.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started: Building Your Family Tree</h2>\n<p>Building and expanding your family tree is the first step in discovering your ancestors' stories with MyHeritage. Begin by visiting <a href=\"http://www.myheritage.com\">MyHeritage</a> and signing up for a free account. Enter your basic information, and you are on your way to building your tree. MyHeritage also allows you to upload a GEDCOM file if you already have a family tree started with another program.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Building family tree on MyHeritage\" src=\"https://gray-wilx-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/IDBZASJISFFGFEAASQLYCWGTPA.bmp?auth=3d2fb4b58060207dbf02ff74a0b93f6f03b819dc999bcd76883f65a0a41de873&amp;width=1200&amp;height=600&amp;smart=true\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Adding Family Members and Details</h2>\n<p>One of the key features of MyHeritage is the ability to easily add new family members. Simply click the plus icon on a person's card and select their relationship to add names, dates, places, and other details. The more information you input, the more likely you are to unlock MyHeritage's unique Discoveries tools which will automatically search and connect you to new records and other users' family trees.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Adding family members\" src=\"https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/images/featured-articles/2023/who-do-you-think-you-are/02126/6.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Discover New Information with Smart Matches™</h2>\n<p>Smart Matches™ is one of MyHeritage's most powerful tools, designed to connect your family tree to other family trees on the platform. When you click the green Smart Match™ icon on a person’s profile, MyHeritage presents you with potential matches. These matches can reveal new or differing information about your ancestors, which you can then confirm and add to your tree. You can even contact other tree owners to corroborate details and ask questions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Discover new information with Smart Matches™\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnQ13npXgAUxH2i.jpg:large\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Growing Your Tree with Instant Discoveries™</h2>\n<p>Instant Discoveries™ takes Smart Matching™ technology a step further by allowing you to add entire branches to your tree with a single click. You can add up to 50 people, along with their details, in one go. Photo Discoveries™, another feature, helps you find long-lost photographs of family members and integrate them into your tree.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Growing your tree with Instant Discoveries™\" src=\"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/a-XSin_iAX_S5LYce1Q5YA/1200x630.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Historical Records Search</h2>\n<p>MyHeritage is home to a vast collection of easily searchable historical records. You can search billions of records from all over the world using simple search queries. The platform’s Global Name Translation™ technology even finds records in different languages. When you discover records related to your ancestors, you can save them to your family members’ profiles and extract all the information to your tree in just a few clicks.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Historical records search\" src=\"https://harrowonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Samuels-in-Kenton0003-1920x1396.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Enhancing and Preserving Family Photos</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting features of MyHeritage is its set of photo enhancement tools. You can scan and upload family photos, then use MyHeritage’s tools to repair, enhance, colorize, and even animate them. Features like MyHeritage In Color™, Photo Enhancer, and Deep Nostalgia™ bring old photos to life, providing a more vivid connection to the past.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Enhancing family photos\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PRfotvgnQbPGDd0Ouz1icbENfzAV7qTWr-Y7rIa15hLVlBubdIXjh5HzEiEzrzykoHFM=h900\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Using MyHeritage DNA</h2>\n<p>MyHeritage’s DNA testing kit offers another avenue to uncover your heritage. By taking a simple cheek swab, you can receive an ethnicity estimate and connect with DNA matches from MyHeritage's global database. DNA Matches can help you find new relatives and make significant progress in your genealogical research. Tools like the Chromosome Browser, Theory of Family Relativity™, and AutoClusters provide insights into how you and your DNA matches are related.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"MyHeritage DNA kit\" src=\"https://content.i4cp.com/images/image_uploads/0000/6656/Story_in_a_book_hero.jpg?1670876519\" style=\"max-width: 900px; height: auto;\"/></p>\n<h2>Participating in the Knowledge Base</h2>\n<p>For those needing extra guidance, MyHeritage offers a comprehensive Knowledge Base filled with articles, videos, and webinars.
