These are relative to player experiences but conclusively are told to be the most fun locations. There’s a lot to explore, be it the wildlife, culture, or the ambience itself. Players can even re-create certain scenarios that they have experienced in the real world. However, there are some locations that have simply mesmerized players so much that they have become the go-to hotspot of many activities. We will be taking a look at some of these places in this guide.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-GmrvdrEtvoFsY6x4cYMc1jOpnUd\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-Uo6Cd0mX7ojPfix1a06cIsoJnae\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong>TAILOR SHOP</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-Uo6Cd0mX7ojPfix1a06cIsoJnae\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/f504d1e01d6912133e94a87874728425.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"/></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-R5F9dPku6ozV4PxDnOMcVNWrn2f\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The Tailor Shop is located at the top centre left side of the main menu. Denoted by a big cone-like structure, this is the go-to place if you’re in town to shop for some clothes. The best part? You can customize them according to your fit and size. This store has a huge assortment of clothing hanging on the racks, as well as a ton of various designer hats and accessories on the shelves and at the front desk. There is a customer and another person who appears to be shaped like a cloud standing around the store. The cloud appears to be limited to wearing hair accessories, but you can try on a variety of outfits by dragging them onto the human customer. Just don’t forget to return everything to its original location once you’ve finished trying them on!</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-RNhZdD6WVo07D5xOhiUcffQ6n2b\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">At the deepest corners of the store you can find some of the best dresses that have been sewen by the master tailor himself. Wait! You can even view the Master Tailor going crazy on the sewing machine itself, making dazzling dresses for celebrities and models.</span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-UQO0dFpXOoF0h4xb4jicqovinCb\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-UQO0dFpXOoF0h4xb4jicqovinCb\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong>DEPARTMENTAL STORE</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-UQO0dFpXOoF0h4xb4jicqovinCb\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/45c2eb441ad3ed20e89341de1648407f.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"/></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-XsXmd3OIno1N34xAMHVc9ZSCngb\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The Department store has a ton of departments, each with their set of uses. You can visit this store when you’re in the need of some extra supplies. The house and kitchen section, the pet section, the grocery store near the end, and the toy section are located in an orderly fashion. You can interact with a lot of the items in different departmental sections of the store. The arcade cabinet in the toy section, the yellow phone on top of the electronics shelf, the loudspeaker between the kitchen and pet shop, and the ATM by the grocery section are just a few examples. A host of interactions can further take place between your characters. Players can hang out at this outlet when they are in the mood to shop, or to simply relax with friends/family.</span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-VSymdgzmroFSePxRtt0cCntjn9f\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-VSymdgzmroFSePxRtt0cCntjn9f\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong>THEATER</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-VSymdgzmroFSePxRtt0cCntjn9f\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/5a97920a74bdf0a5d2e95bf12f2e20e7.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"/></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-OR2ndNGAOoYOmWxqtDHcb3g6nke\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The Theater is one of those buildings that have become iconic with the game. The entire ambience fits the mood, no matter for which reason you visit it for. There’s a clerk greeting us at the front desk of this building, where players are supposed to buy show tickets. You can purchase popcorn, soda, and other presentation-related snacks here as well. The main highlight has to be the beautiful singer dressed as a Valkyrie ready to give a performance of her lifetime. The audience seats and lead guitarist can also be seen waving away to the melodies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-WOnsdQvYcoTRmgxrex4cIyodnDg\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The good times don’t end here. A backstage tour reveals an array of fascinating artifacts and theatrical accessories, such as masks, costumes, props, set dressing, and even a dressing room. Finally, in order to switch between various stage themes, players can also click on the ropes directly behind the stage. Because each rope has a distinct theme, you can mix and match them to create your own unique scenes with your own props and custom characters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-Fbn6dZL8xoqmL6xYL0zcCydCnNg\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-Fbn6dZL8xoqmL6xYL0zcCydCnNg\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong>SALON</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-Fbn6dZL8xoqmL6xYL0zcCydCnNg\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"510\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/182ca13824d5d11dae916d93e33e6ef6.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"920\"/></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-GLzLd1NIUo7vTwxZfq3cmnmknHb\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The Salon is going to greet you right at the front of the alley. As with any salon in the world, the store has a ton of dressing equipment and hair-styling chairs. You can interact with some of the objects. By sitting on any of the hair styling chairs, you will be opening a menu that enlists all the different hair styles available. After choosing one, a hair stylist will greet you and ask for your order. You can even dye your hair, comb them, and wash them after you are done.</span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-C01rdDbNeoL2tDxqUpdch6Nqnab\"> </p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-C01rdDbNeoL2tDxqUpdch6Nqnab\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong>APARTMENTS</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"heading-2 ace-line old-record-id-C01rdDbNeoL2tDxqUpdch6Nqnab\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 181, 234);\"><strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"510\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/8cbea7de8cd4e87e906b4ee69bd4d6b5.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"920\"/></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-YvNCd5kJyoyAJOxbkOhclrsknWf\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">The Apartment will probably be one of those locations that you hold the dearest, simply because you will likely spend the most time here. After you’re done with a busy day, it’s best to simply relax at your home’s comfort and chill alone. Beware though, as alone might not always be an option since Nari and Rita love to crash at your place! Enjoy watching movies, tv shows, or simply gaming at your own leisure. Customize the place according to your needs. Move the furniture, or add more, all up to you!</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-XnR3dsG62o04GGxaQlucYO0Mnue\"> </p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-Qc85d0N1qoden0xkW7wcfAe4ndg\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Playing Toca Life World: Build a Story Now!</span></p>\n<p class=\"ace-line ace-line old-record-id-Qc85d0N1qoden0xkW7wcfAe4ndg\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\"><div class=\"subject-n-wrapper Category-Top-auto-temp\">\n<a class=\"coverlink\" href=\"/details/com-tocaboca-tocalifeworld/4704.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n<div class=\"subject-n-info\">\n<div class=\"editcon-box\">\n<img alt=\"Toca Life World\" class=\"editcon-box-pic\" data-info=\"{'qid':4704,'lang':'en','website':'apkzonic','device':'pc','position':130,'domain':'hot','type':10}\" data-src=\"assets/img/apk/icon/com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld.png\" lazyload=\"\" src=\"/static/img/load.png\"/>\n<div class=\"editcon-box-info\">\n<h3 class=\"editcon-box-info-tl\">Toca Life World</h3>\n<span class=\"editcon-box-info-dev\">Educational</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"editcon-box-ls\">\n<div class=\"editcon-box-item\">\n<div class=\"editcon-item-info\">4.3 <svg class=\"icon-star\">\n<use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"></use>\n</svg>\n</div>\n<span class=\"editcon-box-text\">Ratings</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"editcon-box-item\">\n<span class=\"editcon-item-info\">1.74</span>\n<span class=\"editcon-box-text\">Version</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"editcon-box-item\">\n<span class=\"editcon-item-info\">Toca Boca</span>\n<span class=\"editcon-box-text\">Developer</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"editcon-box-link\">GET</div>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"WhatsApp Messenger\" class=\"editcon-box-img\" src=\"assets/img/Uploads/articles/20240124/1a880f5634107742b970a76e189fb696.png\"/>\n</div></span></p>\n</div> </div>",
