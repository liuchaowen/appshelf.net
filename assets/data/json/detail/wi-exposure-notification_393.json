  "app_descript": "<p><strong>WI Exposure Notification</strong></p>\n<h3>Brief</h3>\n<p>WI Exposure Notification is a crucial tool in the fight against COVID-19, designed to respect user privacy while effectively tracking potential exposure events. This innovative app, available to Wisconsin residents, utilizes Bluetooth technology to anonymously detect and alert individuals if they've been near someone who later tests positive for the virus. Participation is voluntary and designed to work collectively; the more people use it, the better it can help contain the spread.</p>\n<h3>Core Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy-Centric Design</strong>: Ensures no personal data or location tracking is involved for peace of mind 🛡️.</li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth Signal Exchange</strong>: Exchanges anonymous keys with other devices to detect potential exposure 📡.</li>\n<li><strong>Positive Test Verification</strong>: Incorporates a secure verification code system to report COVID-19 diagnoses 📝.</li>\n<li><strong>Exposure Notifications</strong>: Alerts users to potential exposure based on proximity and duration criteria 🚨.</li>\n<li><strong>User-Centric Control</strong>: Users voluntarily decide if they wish to report a positive result and engage with the app 🔍.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free of Charge</strong>: The app is completely free to use for all individuals aged 13 and upwards 👏.</li>\n<li><strong>Built on a Trustworthy Framework</strong>: Developed using the renowned Apple and Google Exposure Notification API ✅.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Deletion</strong>: Keys are stored on-device and deleted after 14 days to protect user privacy 🚮.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimizes False Reporting</strong>: Unique verification codes from health authorities prevent misuse of the reporting feature 🛂.</li>\n<li><strong>Public Health Collaboration</strong>: Created in collaboration with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services for tailored public health response 🤝.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth Dependence</strong>: Requires Bluetooth to be constantly enabled, which might drain battery life quicker 📶.</li>\n<li><strong>Adoption Impact</strong>: The app's effectiveness is dependent on widespread user adoption and engagement 🌐.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Jurisdiction</strong>: Designed exclusively for residents or visitors of Wisconsin, limiting its geographical use📍.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Despite strong privacy measures, some users may still be wary of using exposure notification apps 🕵️‍♂️.</li>\n<li><strong>Age Restriction</strong>: Only intended for users ages 13 and up, which excludes a segment of the population 🚸.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Price</h3>\n<p>WI Exposure Notification is a <strong>free app and does not contain any in-app purchases</strong> 💸.</p>\n<h3>Community</h3>\n<p>The community engagement aspect for this application is not prominent, as its primary function is health-related and operates mainly on an individual's decision to participate in the digital effort against COVID-19.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that all the links provided are accurate as of the time of this description but are subject to change by the app developers or respective platform owners.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>For more information on privacy details, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/privacy.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wisconsin COVID Notice Privacy Policy</a>.</p>",
