Costs incurred are for the parking fees themselves, and there may be transaction charges associated with certain payment methods or account types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the focused utility of PayMyPark as a parking management solution, a community section is not applicable for this application.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.adriley.paymypark\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download PayMyPark for Android</a></p>",
